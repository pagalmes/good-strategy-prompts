## REFINEMENT PROCESS

### Step 1: Feedback Synthesis and Prioritization
First, create a feedback action matrix:

```

Validation Points (Preserve):
- [Strengths identified by judges]
- [Elements that scored highly]
- [Unique insights to maintain]
```

### Step 2: Systematic Improvement Plan

**For each judge's concerns, specify how you'll address them:**

**Judge 1 (Rumelt Expert) Fixes:**
- Diagnosis refinement: [Specific improvements]
- Guiding policy clarification: [Adjustments needed]
- Action coherence enhancement: [Linkage improvements]
- Bad strategy elimination: [Specific removals/corrections]

**Judge 2 (Industry Analyst) Fixes:**
- Market analysis updates: [New data to incorporate]
- Competitive dynamics: [Missing elements to add]
- External evidence: [Sources to include]

**Judge 3 (Financial Analyst) Fixes:**
- Financial constraints: [Reality checks to add]
- Resource allocation: [Adjustments needed]
- ROI projections: [Clarifications required]

**Judge 4 (Implementation Specialist) Fixes:**
- Capability assessments: [Gaps to address]
- Timeline adjustments: [Realistic modifications]
- Measurement framework: [KPIs to refine]

**Judge 5 (Strategic Skeptic) Responses:**
- Assumption validation: [Evidence to provide]
- Sustainability argument: [Strengthening needed]
- Hidden risks: [Acknowledgments to add]

## REFINED STRATEGIC ANALYSIS GENERATION

Create the improved analysis following this enhanced structure:

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
*New addition based on council feedback*
- The strategic imperative (one sentence)
- Why this strategy will succeed (three bullets)
- Critical success factors (three bullets)
- Implementation timeline overview

### PART 1: STRATEGIC DIAGNOSIS (ENHANCED)

**The Critical Challenge:**
[Refined based on Judge 1's feedback - ensure singular focus]

**Root Cause Analysis:**
[Deepened with Judge 2's market insights]
- Primary drivers: [Evidence-based]

- Systemic issues: [Validated assumptions]

**Competitive Dynamics Assessment:**
[Expanded per Judge 2's requirements]
- Current competitive positions: [With market share data]
- Emerging threats: [With specific examples]
- Opportunity windows: [Time-bound and specific]

**Financial Context:**
[Added per Judge 3's concerns]
- Resource constraints: [Specific numbers]
- Investment capacity: [Validated figures]
- Financial health indicators: [Current metrics]

### PART 2: GUIDING POLICY (CLARIFIED)

**Strategic Approach Statement:**
[Refined to address Judge 1 & 5's concerns about genuine advantage]

**Why This Creates Sustainable Advantage:**
[New section addressing skeptic's concerns]
1. Difficult to replicate because: [Specific barriers]
2. Leverages unique capabilities: [Validated strengths]
3. Anticipates competitor responses: [Scenario planning]

**Explicit Trade-offs:**
[Enhanced per council feedback]
- We WILL: [3-5 specific commitments]
- We WILL NOT: [3-5 specific exclusions]
- Resource reallocation FROM: [Specific areas] TO: [Strategic priorities]

### PART 3: COHERENT ACTIONS (STRENGTHENED)

**Initiative Portfolio:**
[Reorganized to show interdependencies per Judge 4]

| Initiative | Timeframe | Resources | Dependencies | Success Metrics | Risk Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Action 1] | Q1-Q2 | $X, Y FTEs | None (Quick win) | [Specific KPI] | [Plan B] |
| [Action 2] | Q2-Q4 | $X, Y FTEs | Requires Action 1 | [Specific KPI] | [Plan B] |
| [Continue for all actions...] |

**Coherence Map:**
[Visual or narrative showing how actions reinforce each other]
```
Action 1 enables → Action 2 which supports → Action 3
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Capability A built → Market position B → Revenue stream C
```

**Implementation Roadmap:**
[Enhanced with Judge 4's implementation concerns]
- Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation building
  - Quick wins: [Specific achievements]
  - Capability development: [Specific skills/systems]
